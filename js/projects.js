When the user swipes their tag, the Arduino board reads the tag's unique identifier and compares it to a pre-programmed list of authorized users. If the tag is valid, the Arduino sends a signal to the locking mechanism, allowing the door to unlock. The system requires an RFID reader, a locking mechanism, an Arduino board, and some programming knowledge. The RFID reader reads the data from the RFID tag, and the Arduino board processes that data to determine whether access should be granted or not.
